    <p><h2>Ingredients</h2></p>
    <p><h4>For the ragù:</h4></p>
    <p><ul><li><em>Half of a yellow onion, diced</em></li>
        <li><em>One pound ground beef</em></li>
    <li><em>Four garlic cloves, diced</em></li>
<li><em>Three tablespoons tomato paste</em></li>
<li><em>Two 28-oz cans crushed tomatoes</em></li>
<li><em>Bunch of basil leaves, torn, stems removed</em></li>
<li><em>Salt to taste</em></li></ul></p>
<p><h4>For the ricotta filling:</h4></p>
<p><ul><li><em>One 32-oz container of ricotta cheese</em></li>
<li><em>One package of frozen spinach, thawed and squeezed of all excess moisture</em></li>
<li><em>2/3 cup grated Pecorino Romano cheese</em></li>
<li><em>One large egg</em></li>
<li><em>1/4 teaspoon freshly grated nutmeg</em></li>
<li><em>Salt and pepper to taste</em></li></ul></p>
<p><h4>Additional ingredients:</h4></p>
<p><ul><li><em>One 1-lb box of lasagna pasta</em></li>
<li><em>One 16-oz block of mozzarella cheese</em></li></ul></p>
<p><h2>Method</h2></p>
<ol><li><strong>Make the ragù:</strong> Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. In a Dutch oven or heavy bottomed pot, heat some olive oil until shimmering. Add the diced onion and cook until slightly golden. Add the ground beef and cook until browned, breaking up with a wooden spoon. Add the garlic and tomato paste and cook until fragrant, stirring frequently. Once the tomato paste has darkened in color, add the crushed tomatoes and basil along with about 1 tomato can's worth of water. Stir to combine. Season with salt and let simmer for 1-2 hours, or until thickened, stirring occasionally. Taste for salt and adjust seasonings as necessary. </li></p>
<p><li><strong>Make the ricotta filling:</strong> In a separate bowl, combine the ricotta with the spinach, Pecorino Romano cheese, egg, nutmeg, salt, and pepper. Mix thoroughly to combine. Set aside or refrigerate until needed.</li></p>
<p><li><strong>Prepare the pasta:</strong>Meanwhile, cook lasagna sheets in a large pot of salted, boiling water until slightly undercooked, about 8 minutes. Drain the pasta and set the lasagna sheets aside, separated in layers with paper towels so as to prevent sticking. Grate the mozzarella cheese and set aside.</li></p>
<p><li><strong>Assemble the lasagna:</strong> Spoon a layer of ragù on the bottom of an oven-safe 9x13 casserole dish. Then, add overlapping lasagna sheets until the sauce is fully covered. Carefully spread a layer of the ricotta mixture on top of the pasta, then cover with another layer of ragù. Repeat this process until you have several layers. The last layer should end with ragù on top. Cover the exposed sauce with the grated mozzarella cheese.</li></p>
<p><li><strong>Bake:</strong> Cover the lasagna with aluminum foil and bake for about 25 minutes, or until the cheese is fully melted. Uncover and bake for an additional 5-10 minutes, or until the mozzarella begins to brown. Remove from oven and let cool slightly before serving. Enjoy!</li></p></ol>
